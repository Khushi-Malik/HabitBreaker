# HabitBreaker

**An empathetic AI companion that helps you break bad habits—without judgment, without guilt.**

## What It Does

HabitBreaker is your personal habit-breaking companion that learns your patterns and supports you through the journey. Unlike traditional habit trackers that punish streaks and shame relapses, HabitBreaker treats every moment as data, not failure.

The app features an AI avatar that:
- Observes when you struggle with habits
- Sends gentle notifications before vulnerable moments
- Lives on your home screen through widgets
- Celebrates progress without pressuring perfection

## Core Features

## Philosophy

> "You don't quit habits by force. You quit them by understanding them."

HabitBreaker is built on three principles:

1. **Relapses are data, not failure** - Every trigger logged is progress
2. **Patterns over pressure** - Understanding why beats willpower alone  
3. **Support, not shame** - The companion never judges, only helps

## Why It Matters

268 million people worldwide are actively trying to break habits. Most apps approach this with guilt and discipline. HabitBreaker offers something different: understanding and support.

This app exists because breaking habits is hard enough without an app making you feel worse about it.
